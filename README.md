> a static-typed koa2 framework with typescript.

This is an MVC framework based on node.js and koa2 (old version is based on express). The framework is created by typescript, which includes a dependency injection system and RESTful high-level abstraction.

The core features are under development. Currently, the dependency injection system is basically completed, the controller module is basically completed, and the GET method is also completed.
